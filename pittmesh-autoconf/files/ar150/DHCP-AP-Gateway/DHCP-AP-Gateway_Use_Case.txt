The device set in DHCP-AP-Gateway configuration is the "standard" configuration for PittMesh routers. This configuration assumes that the device is
A) connected to an upstream router on its WAN port and is receiving DHCP and gateway information from that router
B) Serving clients in its WiFi cell as a normal Access Point would do
c) Sharing its path to its hardwired, non-mesh gateway to the Internet.

This is accomplished by 
A) Setting the WAN interface to be configured via DHCP
B) Ensuring the bridged LAN-WLAN interface has a DHCP server running on it and force serves a 10.x.x.x/24 IP address to connecting clients
C) Creates an HNA announcement for 0.0.0.0/0 as well as the 10.x.x.x/24 subnet.

This is meant to be a plug-and-plug configuration with changes needed only to the hostname and the AP SSID name.
